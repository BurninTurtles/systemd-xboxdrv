place configurations here.

for a device with a single configuration, simply create 
a config named your controllers vendor:product IDs appended with .xboxdrv.
ex I have a microsoft wired xbox360 controller. its IDs are
[vendor:045e product:028e]
therefore, i name my config file "045e:028e.xboxdrv"

for a device with multiple configurations do the following
1. make the controller config file as above, adding only options 
unrelated to layouts [eg chatpad, mimicxpad]
2. create a folder of the same name minus ".xboxdrv"
3. inside the folder, create configs named config0.xboxdrv, config1.xboxdrv, etc.
containing your layout options

the folder structure is loosely based on the file written by "xboxdrv --write-config"
